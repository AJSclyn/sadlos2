<h1>Error Messages</h1>
<table><tr><th>Error Message</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td class="absorbing-column">Testing for message: <></td><td>This test message is just a test, so dont panic.</td></tr><tr><td class="absorbing-column">The second test: <></td><td>This second test is pretty serious. You should just stop developing.</td></tr><tr><td class="absorbing-column">Third is the charm only if <> is chosen based on <></td><td>This error is caused by winning. Which I think makes it not an error.</td></tr><tr><td class="absorbing-column">This is becoming serious... how can we fix that it says <>?</td><td>This can be caused because you ate your food too fast. Next time slow down, and you could really have a chance to do something with your life.</td></tr><tr><td class="absorbing-column">Just kidding. <> really means <></td><td>This is actually serious. Confusing, isnt it?</td></tr></table>
